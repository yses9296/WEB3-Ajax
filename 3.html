    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
        technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on
        the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers
        have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
        Object Model (DOM).
